# DOCUMENTATION
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# A list of documentation file in .md format that should be viewable from the
# web interface. These files are in the 'docs' subdirectory. The first file
# listed will be used as a documentation index and is index.md by convention
documentation_files:
  - ['index.md', 'chipseq-analysis']

# NEXTFLOW WORKFLOW CONFIGURATION
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Remember - The workflow file is always named 'workflow/main.f'
#            The workflow must publish all final output into $baseDir

# A list of clueter environment modules that this workflow requires to run.
# Specify versioned module names to ensure reproducability.
workflow_modules:
  - 'deeptools/2.3.5'
  - 'meme/4.11.1-gcc-openmpi'

# A list of parameters used by the workflow, defining how to present them,
# options etc in the web interface. For each parameter:
#
# REQUIRED INFORMATION
#  id:         The name of the parameter in the NEXTFLOW workflow
#  type:       The type of the parameter, one of:
#                string    - A free-format string
#                integer   - An integer
#                real      - A real number
#                file      - A single file from user data
#                files     - One or more files from user data
#                select    - A selection from a list of values
#  required:    true/false, must the parameter be entered/chosen?
#  description: A user friendly description of the meaning of the parameter
#
# OPTIONAL INFORMATION
#  default:   A default value for the parameter (optional)
#  min:       Minium value/characters/files for number/string/files types
#  max:       Maxumum value/characters/files for number/string/files types
#  regex:     A regular expression that describes valid entries / filenames
#
# SELECT TYPE
#  choices:   A set of choices presented to the user for the parameter.
#             Each choice is a pair of value and description, e.g.
#
#             choices:
#               - [ 'myval', 'The first option']
#               - [ 'myval', 'The second option']
#
# NOTE - All parameters are passed to NEXTFLOW as strings... but they
#        are validated by astrocyte using the information provided above
